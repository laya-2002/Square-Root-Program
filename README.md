# Square-Root-Program
A computer program to find square root of a positive integer, if there is no pre-defined function to find it in a programming language. 
My idea :
During COVID-19 lockdown, I was practicing the programming on a website. The website have online IDE, for compiling the programs. One of the problems is to find hypotenuese of a right-angled triangle. I started doing the problem in C language. For finding the square root, I have used "#include<math.h>" library in the code, and "sqrt" pre-defined function too. But after compiling, that IDE is showing error. sqrt() is  undefined it displayed. So, I was unable to find the square root in the program.
At that time, I got an idea to create a function which finds square root of a positive integer. 
Then I have created this program and tried to find square root of a positive integer.
The program was successful in finding square roots.
In this way, I have solved the problem of finding hypotenuese of a right-angled triangle.
